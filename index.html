<div class = "p2home">I highly recommend the recipes and travel destinations on this website. If the opportunity arises, I suggest making the trip to Lake Tahoe. Lake Tahoe is my favorite place to go during the summer and is a cheap alternative compared to the other travel destinations. Another recommendation of mine is to make the Chinese Hot and Sour Soup. If you like spice, this dish is right up your alley. To add some cuteness to the page, there are five pets on the website. My personal favorite is Sage!</div>
